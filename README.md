# ubuntu-setup

My setup for a clean new Ubuntu installation

### What is this?

I created this script to automate the installation of everything I need for my Ubuntu.

### How to use?

1. Clone the repo

2. Open `install.sh` to review the script before running

3. If you use [VSCode Settings Sync](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync), edit `GITHUB_GIST_TOKEN` (line 12) and `GITHUB_GIST_ID` (line 13) to your values

4. Scroll down to line 544 and comment out packages you don't want to install

5. Save the file

6. Open a terminal and run `./install.sh`, you'll be asked for password to run sudo commands
